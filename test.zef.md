# Test Zef Markdown

This is a test file for the Zef extension.


```python
print("Hello from Zef!")
x = 42
```

Some more text here.

```python
print(f"The answer is {x}")
y = x * 2
print(f"Double is {y}")
```

And a final block:

```python
import datetime
print(f"Current time: {datetime.datetime.now()}")
```
